    <p class='article-content'>
        </p>Some lessons require repetition to lock them into memory and tutorials, coding exercises, and coding projects do not always provide
        this. Flashcards prompt you to recall information and formulate responses so the learning is active as well as repetitive.
        Lessons are covered quickly so it is a time-efficient way to supplement learning.</p>
        </p>Code Driller presents Python flashcards in your web browser. Submitting flashcards to Code Driller gives you a 
        convenient way to document lessons as you learn them. They will be available to you at any time for review along with content others 
        submit. Flashcards can be useful to prepare for coding certification exams.</p>
        </p>If you register and login, you will be able to add, archive, flag, and rate cards by upvoting or downvoting them. Anything you
        contribute to Code Driller becomes public domain content. Do not post copyrighted content and flag any card that you suspect is
        copyrighted, off-topic, or is inappropriate. Users can flag as many as three cards within a month.</p>
        </p>Cards you archive or downvote will not be presented to you until you have seen all available cards. Users are presented low-rated
        cards less frequently than higher-rated cards. The most poorly rated cards are deleted so your input improves quality of the content.
        </p>When you are writing a new card, it is usually best to answer the question with code. Here is an example:</p>
        <br /><p>

            {% for post in cards.items %}
              {% if post.id == 431 %}
        
                <a class="ml-3 text-muted" <h1>Question</h1></a>
                  <article class="media content-section">
                  <div class="media-body">
                    <b>
                    <p class="article-content">{{ post.question }}</p>
                    </b>
                  </div>
                  </article>
        
                <a class="ml-3 text-muted" <h1>Answer</h1></a>
                  <article class="media content-section">
                  <div class="media-body">
                    <b>
                    <p class="article-content">{{ post.answer }}</p>
                    </b>
                  </div>
                  </article>
